 * This is a tool to index, then query or search C, C++, Java and Python source code.
 * It builds upon the databases of cscope and Exuberant ctags.
 * The databases of cscope and ctags would be processed by the cqmakedb tool to
 * generate the CodeQuery database file.
 * The CodeQuery database file can be viewed and queried using the codequery GUI tool.
 *
 * This contains only the Doxygen documentation of the source code.
